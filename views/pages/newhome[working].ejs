                  Historically, JHMC has been in person, but due to the COVID
                  pandemic last year, we brought the contest online. After the
                  success of last year's contest, and the fixing of many of the
                  bugs our first run had, we're maintaining an online division for
                  this test in 2023 to give students across the world the same
                  opportunity to compete and grow that Illinois middle-school
                  students had for the past 32 years.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This year, we're bringing JHMC to more schools and students
                  around the world through online testing. Experience our reliable
                  testing software below. Students from schools outside of
                  Illinois and from Illinois schools we weren't able to fit into
                  the in-person division will be able to attend this contest
                  either as part of a school team, or, if their school can't field
                  a team, as an ad-hoc team. More about this can be found in the
                  updated rules doc linked above.
