            <h5>What needs must be addressed?</h5>
            <p>Ever since the first IMSA JHMC was held decades ago, our mission
                and core values have remained unchanged. We continue to believe
                that <strong>middle school is an oft-neglected but critical formative
                period for STEM-oriented students</strong>, during which a student's
                positive or negative experiences have an outsize impact on their
                future educational attainment. This is backed up by results from
                peer-reviewed studies: for example,
                <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00220670309596624">
                    Wang and Goldschmidt 2003
                </a>
                finds that differences in mathematical opportunities during
                middle school translates to increasing educational inequity
                into high school.</p>
            <p>We believe that creating more opportunities for students to have
                positive experiences with mathematics will not only increase
                equity for disadvantaged students but also translate into better
                academic and career outcomes across the board for all participants.
                <strong>This is a deeply personal issue for many of us</strong>:
                almost all of the contest organizers are where we are today in no
                small part due to opportunities like MATHCOUNTS and the AMC 8,
                which gave us an outlet to have fun with STEM.
            </p>
            <h5>How do we improve on existing programs?</h5>
            <p>We believe that an effective mathematics outreach program has two
                key traits: first, it <strong>makes math fun</strong>, and second, it gives
                students <strong>the opportunity to discover</strong> deep insights on their
                own. We believe that this second trait can't be achieved by simply
                "skimming the surface" of mathematics: while the gems of discovery
                might not be buried deep, students need to seek them out in extended
                problem-solving experiences, experiences which contests like the
                AMC 8 don't provide.
            </p>
            <p>Hence, we seek to expand on more conventional contest-math rounds
                in JHMC by diving deeper with our unique Creative Thinking
                round, where students solve short sets of themed problems extending
                beyond the normal middle school curriculum. This lets students discover
                deeper insights than what other middle school contests provide. We
                believe that this opportunity, provided during the critical time
                of middle school, among the relatively few nationwide math contests
                targeting this demographic, will significantly benefit both the
                math community and our country at large.
            </p>
            <p>
                For the foregoing reasons, we have decided on the following for
                the 2022 JHMC mission statement:
            </p>
            <blockquote>"The IMSA Junior High Mathematics Competition aims to
                foster genuine interest in STEM by providing
                high-quality, intriguing problems across a wide breadth and depth
                to a diverse community of students at the middle school level."
                </blockquote>
