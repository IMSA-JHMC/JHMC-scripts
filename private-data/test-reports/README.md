# `test-reports`

This directory holds all of the student score reports, which are sorted by both the school and the competition. Note that it may break if two students have the same name. 

Anyways, just like `test-reports`, to generate this, in the root folder, run
```
ts-node --files one-time-scripts/grading/grade.ts
```
